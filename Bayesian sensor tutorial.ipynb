    "\n",
    "So you've heard about the [bayesian sensor](https://home-assistant.io/components/binary_sensor.bayesian/) in home-assistant, and would like to know what it's good for and how to use it. The bayesian (bayes for short) sensor should be used when you want a sensor which indicates the state of a system that you cannot directly measure. Lets consider a hypothetical scenario where want a sensor that indicates whether or not someone is cooking in the kitchen. We will call the sensor **sensor.cooking** and when someone is cooking the state is ON, otherwise the state is OFF. To be consistent with the wikipedia article on [Bayes theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem) lets refer to the state ON as 'event $A$' and the state OFF as 'event $\\neg A$' where the $\\neg$ symbol indicates 'not' $A$. I estimate that roughly 10% of the time someone is cooking, so if your were to enter the kitchen at a random time the probability ($P$) that you would find someone cooking (event $A$) is $P(A)$ = 0.1. Clearly I can then state that 90% of the time nobody will be cooking, and $P(\\neg A) = 1 - P(A)$ = 0.9. We can represent this probability distribution graphically:"

    "Lets say that I create **sensor.cooking** at a random time with no knowledge about whether someone is cooking at the time. My initial belief about the likelihood that someone is cooking ($P(A)$) is reffered to as the *prior*, as it is my belief prior to any measurement. We have previously established that the prior, $P(A)$ = 0.1. Lets say that I have built a DIY sensor for detecting cooking smells and through experimentation I have concluded that it measures a true-positive ON 70% of the time when someone is cooking. I call the ON state of this DIY sensor 'event $B$' and can now state the likelihood that this sensor is ON *given* that someone is cooking is 70%. In algebraic notation, *given* is represented by the $|$ symbol and I can now state that the likelihood $P(A|B)$ = 0.7. However this DIY sensor is not perfect and measures a false-positive ON 10% of the time. We capture this false-positive likelihood in the expression $P(B| \\neg A)$ = 0.1. \n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that we now have enough information to calculate the propbability that we really care about, $P(A|B)$ which is the probability that someone is cooking *given* that we measured an ON with the DIY sensor.
